# TRACECLEANUP
Data cleansing algorithm for FINRA's Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) for python.

As of March 18, 2019 a revised sequence filter is near completion. I'm in the final stages of paramater testing which will optimize Type I and Type II error with generality in mind. My advisor and I should be submitting our a paper within the month which will condense both Nielsen's and our efforts to streamline fixed-income research, specifically for TRACE.
